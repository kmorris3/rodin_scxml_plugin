\section{Introduction}
We formalise the semantics of refinement in SCXML by modelling, in Event-B,
\begin{itemize}
	\item the structure and behaviour of abstract SCXML models,
	\item the structure, behaviour of refined SCXML models and their relationship to abstract models.
	\item We then refine the latter to remove verification artifacts and show that it is no different to the abstract model and hence SCXML refinement can be applied iteratively.
\end{itemize}

Since SCXML consists of a state-chart behaviour superimposed with a 'run to completion' execution semantics, we formalise the refinement of these two parts separately and then compose the two definitions to obtain the complete SCXMl refinement semantics.
