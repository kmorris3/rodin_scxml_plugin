\section{The semantics of refining an SCXML Run to Completion}

To define the SCXML run to completion execution we first define the static elements involved: 
Triggers are partitioned into either Internal or External triggers
|partition (TRIGGERS, InternalTriggers, ExternalTriggers, {nullTrigger})|
A null trigger |nullTrigger| is introduced for convenience to simplify the definition of the initial condition: the execution begins by firing untriggered transitions which is otherwise only done after a trigger is consumed. Hence the null Trigger is said to be consumed during initialisation.

We define the internal and external trigger queues as subsets of internal, resp. external triggers
|	InternalQueue = ℙ(InternalTriggers)|
|	ExternalQueue = ℙ(ExternalTriggers)|
