\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

Reactive \SCs are useful and widely used by engineers for modelling the design of control systems. 
\EventB provides an effective language for formally verifying properties via incremental refinements.
However, it is not straightforward to apply the latter to the former.
We have demonstrated a technique for introducing refinement of reactive \SCs that can be translated to \EventB for verification.
Invariant properties about the expected coordination of states can be added and are interpreted with additional allowance for the reactions to take place.
That is, they hold only after the reaction has taken place.
Such invariants prove automatically with the existing Rodin theorem provers.
We also demonstrate a complimentary process for verifying expected reactions to environmental triggers that uses the \LTL model checker.
In future work we intend to formalise the semantics of our extended \SCXML notation in order to define its notion of refinement and correspondence to \EventB.
