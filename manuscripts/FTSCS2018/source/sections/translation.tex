\section{\SCXML Translation}
\label{sec:translation}

The translation from \SCXML to \EventB is based on an abstract `basis' that models the `run to completion' semantics. 
This basis consists of an \EventB \emph{context} and \emph{machine} that are the same for all input models and are refined by the specific output of the translation.  
The basis context, Listing~\ref{lst:BasisContext}, introduces a given set of all possible triggers that is partitioned into internal and external ones, some of which will be introduced in future refinements. 
Refinements partition these trigger sets further to introduce concrete triggers, leaving a new abstract set to represent the remaining triggers yet to be introduced. 
For example, the \IDS model introduces a specific internal trigger, \textbf{spi\_done},  by partitioning |SCXML_FutureInternalTrigger| into the singleton \textbf{\{spi\_done\}} and a new set, |SCXML_FutureInternalTrigger0|, representing the remainder.

% end
% \end{lstlisting}

The basis machine, part of which is shown in Listing~\ref{lst:BasisMachine}, declares variables that correspond to the triggers present in the queue at any given time, and a flag, |SCXML_uc|, that signals when a run to completion macro-step has been completed (no un-triggered transitions are enabled). 
After initialisation, both trigger queues are empty and |SCXML_uc| is set to |FALSE| so that un-triggered transitions are dealt with. 
The basis machine provides events that describe the generic behaviour of models that follow the run to completion semantics in terms of altering the trigger queues and completion flag.
Since new events introduced in a refinement cannot modify existing variables, all future events generated by translation of the specific \SCXML model, will refine these abstract events.
The abstract event, |SCXML_futureExternalTrigger| represents the raising of an external trigger.    
The abstract event, |SCXML_futureInternalTransitionSet| represents a combination of transitions that are triggered by an internal trigger. 
The guards of this event ensure prior completion of the previous macro-step. 
A similar event, |SCXML_futureExternalTransitionSet| (not shown) represents a combination of transitions that are triggered by an external trigger and has the additional guard that the internal trigger queue is empty.
These two triggered transition events reset the completion flag to ensure that any un-triggered transitions that may have become enabled have a chance to fire next.
The abstract event |SCXML_futureUntriggeredTransitionSet| represents a combination of transitions that are un-triggered and may only be fired when the completion flag is unset (FALSE).
It leaves the completion flag unset in case further combinations of un-triggered transitions are enabled.
All three of these transition events also allow for raising a non-deterministic set of internal triggers.
A final abstract event, |SCXML_completion|, sets the completion flag (TRUE) if it is not already set. At this abstract basis level, this is non-deterministically fired since we do not yet have any detail of what needs to be completed.

The translation of a specific \SCXML model comprises two stages as follows. 
Firstly, all possible combinations of transitions that can fire together are calculated and corresponding events are generated, at appropriate refinement levels, that refine the abstract basis events.  
If these transitions raise internal triggers, a guard, (e.g. |{i1, i2, ...} <: SCXML_raisedTrigger|, where |i1, i2, ...| have been added to the internal triggers set), is introduced that defines the raised triggers parameter. 
The subset constraint leaves it open for more raised triggers to be added by later refinements.
For triggered transition combinations, the trigger is specified in a guard (see line~\ref{line:defTrigger} of Listing~\ref{lst:SecBotMach0}) that provides a value for the trigger parameter.

%	SCXML_raisedTriggers ⊆ SCXML_FutureInternalTrigger
%	InitialiseSensor = TRUE

%then
%	SCXML_uc ≔ FALSE
%	SCXML_iq ≔ (SCXML_iq ∪ SCXML_raisedTriggers) ∖ {SCXML_it}
%	InitialiseSensor ≔ FALSE
%	Wait50ms ≔ TRUE
%end
%\end{lstlisting}

Secondly, the \SCXML state-chart is translated into a corresponding iUML-B state-machine whose transitions elaborate (i.e. add state change details to) the possible transition combination events that the transition may be involved in. 
A transition may fire in parallel with transitions of parallel nested state-machines that have the same (possibly null) trigger.
Fig.~\ref{fig:iumlb-verif} shows the generated \iUMLB first refinement level corresponding to the \IDS described in Fig.~\ref{fig:ASIC_SPI_1}. 
% Table~\ref{tab:translation_rules} provides a summary of the main SCXML to iUML-B/Event-B translation rules.
The main rules for the translation of SCXML features to iUML-B/Event-B can be summarized as follow:

\begin{description}
\item[Top level SCXML model:] Generates a refinement chain of \EventB machines each containing an initialisation event and a \iUMLB state-machine.
The depth of the refinement chain is found by searching the \SCXML for the maximum refinement annotation.

%\item[Top level invariant:] An invariant owned by an \EventB machine produced from the containing \SCXML. Added only at the refinement level defined in the invariant (default 0) 

\item[State:] Generates a state in the \iUMLB state-machine that has been produced from the container of the \SCXML state. 
A refined state is also added in all of the refinements of the parent \iUMLB state-machine. 
E.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:ASIC_SPI_1}, \textbf{Initialise Buzzer} |-->| Fig.~\ref{fig:iumlb-verif}, |InitialiseBuzzer|.

\item[State invariant:] Generates an invariant in the \iUMLB state corresponding to the \SCXML state that contains the invariant. 
Added only at the refinement level defined in the invariant (defaults to first level at which containing \iUMLB state is introduced). 
E.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:iumlb-verif}, |Idle = TRUE| is generated from an invariant attached (not shown) to the state \textbf{Go} of Fig.~\ref{fig:ASIC_SPI_1}.

\item[Parallel Region:] Generates an \iUMLB state-machine in the state corresponding to the owner of the parallel region. 
The nested \iUMLB state-machine is added starting from the refinement level that is annotated on the parallel region and continuing throughout subsequent refinements. 
E.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:ASIC_SPI_1}, right hand region |-->| Fig.~\ref{fig:iumlb-verif}, lower nested state-machine.

%\item[State (with nested states):] A nested \iUMLB state-machine, with an initial state, is added to the \iUMLB state that has been produced from the source state, if any, or from its containing state if it did not produce an \iUMLB state. The nested \iUMLB state-machine is added starting from the refinement level that is annotated on the source state and continuing throughout subsequent refinements.

\item[Initial:] Generates an \iUMLB initial state, and a transition from it to the \iUMLB state indicated in the \SCXML initial attribute. 
The \iUMLB initial state and \iUMLB transition are added at all refinement levels. The \iUMLB transitions are set to elaborate the \EventB INITIALISATION event for that refinement level.
E.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:ASIC_SPI_1}, initial state and transition in right hand region |-->| Fig.~\ref{fig:iumlb-verif}, initial state and transition in lower nested state-machine.

\item[Final:] Generates an \iUMLB state with a transition to a final state in the state-machine that has been generated from the containing \SCXML state. 
The transition elaborates the same events that are linked to the transitions that exit the parent \iUMLB state. 
The \iUMLB state, final state and transition are also added as refined elements to all of the refinements of the parent \iUMLB state-machine.
(Not used in our example).

\item[Transition:] Generates an \iUMLB transition in the state-machine that has been generated from the containing \SCXML state. 
The \iUMLB transition’s source and target are those that have been generated from the \SCXML transition’s source and target states. 
The transition elaborates generated \EventB events according to the rules given in Section ~\ref{sec:translation}. 
The \iUMLB transition and elaborated \EventB events are also added as corresponding refined elements in all of the refinements of the parent \iUMLB state-machine.
E.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:ASIC_SPI_1}, \textbf{send\_message} |-->| Fig.~\ref{fig:iumlb-verif}, |send_message__Idle_SendingMessage|.

%\item[Target:] Attribute of a transition element. Used to determine the transitions target state as described above

A tool to automatically translate \SCXML models into \iUMLB has been produced. 
The tool is based on the \EMF and uses an \SCXML meta-model provided by Sirius~\cite{siriuswebsite} which has good support for extensibility. 
%The tooling for \iUMLB and \EventB already contains \EMF meta-models and provides a generic translator framework which has been specialised for the \SCXML to \iUMLB translation. 
The iUML-B state-machine is subsequently translated into Event-B using the standard iUML-B translation~\cite{snook14:_b_statem} which provides variables to model the current state and guards and actions to model the state changes that transitions perform.
