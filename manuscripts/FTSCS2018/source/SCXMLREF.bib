	abstract="UML-B is a `UML like' notation based on the Event-B formalism which allows models to be progressively detailed through refinements that are proven to be consistent and to satisfy safety invariants using the Rodin platform and its automatic proof tools. UML, on the other hand, encourages large models to be expressed in a single, detailed level and relies on simulation and model testing techniques for verification. The advantage of proof over model-testing is that the proof is valid for all instantiations of the model whereas a simulation must choose a typical instantiation. In the INESS project we take an extant UML model of a railway interlocking system and explore methodical ways to translate it into UML-B in such a way as to facilitate proof that the model satisfies certain safety properties which are expressed as invariants. We describe the translation attempted so far and insights that we have gained from attempting to prove a safety property. We propose some possible improvements to the translation which we believe will make the proof easier.",

abstract="We present a framework for formal veri.cation of a realtime extension of UML statecharts. For clarity, we restrict ourselves to a reasonable subset of the rich UML statechart model and extend this with real-time constructs (clocks, timed guards, and invariants). We equip the obtained formalism, called hierarchical timed automata (HTA), with an operational semantics. We outline a translation of one HTA to a network of flat timed automata, that can serve as input to the real-time model checking tool Uppaal. This translation can be used to faithfully verify deadlock-freedom, safety, and unbounded response properties of the HTA model. We report on an XML-based implementation of this translation, use the well-known pacemaker example to illustrate our technique, and report run-time data for the formal verification part.",

Our work is distinctive in two ways:Â a semantics for refinement and for a representative collection of elements from the UML4SysML profileÂ (blocks, state machines, activities, and interactions) used in combination. We provide a means to analyse and refine design models specified using SysML. This facilitates the discovery of problems earlier in the system development lifecycle, reducing time, and costs of production. Here, we describe our semantics, which is defined using a state-rich process algebra and implemented in a tool for automatic generation of formal models. We also show how the semantics can be used for refinement-based analysis and development. Our case study is a leadership-election protocol, a critical component of an industrial application. Our major contribution is a framework for reasoning using refinement about systems specified by collections of SysML diagrams.",
