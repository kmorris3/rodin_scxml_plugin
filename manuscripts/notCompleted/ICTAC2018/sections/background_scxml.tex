\subsection{SCXML}
\label{sec:scxml}

\SCXML is a modelling language based on Harel \statecharts with facilities for adding data elements that are manipulated by transition actions and used in conditions for their firing. \SCXML follows the usual `run to completion' semantics of such \statechart languages, where trigger events\footnote{In \SCXML the triggers are called `events', however, we refer to them as `triggers' to avoid confusion with \EventB} may be needed to enable transitions. Trigger events are queued when they are raised and then one is de-queued and consumed by firing all the transitions that it enables, followed by any (un-triggered) transitions that then become enabled due to the change of state caused by the initial transition firing. This is repeated until no transitions are enabled and then the next trigger is de-queued and consumed. There are two kinds of triggers: internal triggers are raised by transitions and external triggers are raised by the environment (spontaneously as far as our model is concerned). An external trigger may only be consumed when the internal trigger queue has been emptied. Listing~\ref{lst:scxml-r2c} shows a pseudocode representation of the run to completion semantics as defined within the latest W3C recommendation document~\cite{scxmlwebsite}. Here IQ and EQ are the triggers present in the internal and external queues respectively. 

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Pseudocode for 'run to completion',label={lst:scxml-r2c}, frame=single, float=t]
while running:
	while run2completion = false
		if untriggered_enabled
			execute(untriggered())
		elseif IQ /= {}
			execute(internal(IQ.dequeue)) 
		else
			run2completion = true
		endif
	endwhile
	if EQ /= {}
		execute(EQ.dequeue) 
		run2completion = false
	endif
endwhile 
\end{lstlisting}

We adopt the commonly used terminology where a single transition is called a \emph{micro-step} and a complete run (between de-queueing external triggers) is referred to as a \emph{macro-step}.
