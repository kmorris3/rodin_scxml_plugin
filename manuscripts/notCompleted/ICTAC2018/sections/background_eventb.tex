\subsection{Event-B}
\label{sec:eventb}

\EventB~\cite{abrial10:_model_event_b} is a formal method for system
development.  Main features of \EventB include the use of
\emph{refinement} to introduce system details gradually into the
formal model.  An \EventB model contains two parts: \emph{contexts} and \emph{machines}. Contexts contain \emph{carrier sets}, \emph{constants}, and \emph{axioms} constraining the carrier sets and constants.  Machines contain \emph{variables} |v|, \emph{invariants} |I(v)| constraining the variables, and \emph{events}. An event comprises a guard denoting its enabled-condition and an action describing how the variables are modified when the event is executed.  In general, an event |e| has the following form, where |t| are the event parameters, |G(t, v)| is the guard of the event, and |S(t, v)| is the action of the event.
\begin{center}
  |any t where G(t, v) then S(t, v) end|
%& \inlineevent{\Be}{}{\Bt}{G(\Bt,\Bv)}{}{S(\Bt,\Bv)}
\end{center}
In the case where the event has no parameters, we use the following form
\begin{center}
  |when G(v) then S(v) end|
%& \inlineevent{\Be}{}{}{G(\Bv)}{}{S(\Bv)}~,
\end{center}
and when the event has no parameters and no guard, we use
\begin{center}
  |begin S(v) end|
%& \inlineevent{\Be}{}{}{}{}{S(\Bv)}~.
\end{center}
The action of an event comprises of one or more assignments, each of them has one of the following forms: (1) |v := E(t, v)|, (2) |v :: E(t, v)|, and (3) |v :âˆ£ P(t, v)|.  Assignments of form (1) are deterministic, assign the value of expression |E(t, v)| to |v|.  Assignments of forms (2) and (3) are non-deterministic. (2) assigns any value from the set |E(t,v)| to |v|, while (3) assigns any value satisfied predicate |P(t,v)| to |v|.
A machine in \EventB corresponds to a transition system
where \emph{variables} represent the states and \emph{events} specify
the transitions.  Note that invariants |I(v)| are inductive, i.e., they must be \emph{maintained} by all events. This is more strict than general safety properties which hold for all reachable states of the \EventB machine.  This is also the difference between verifying the consistency of \EventB machines using theorem proving and model checking (e.g., \PROB) techniques: model checkers explore all reachable states of the system while interpreting the invariants as safety properties.  

Machines can be refined by adding more details.  Refinement can be done by extending the machine to include additional variables (\emph{superposition refinement}) representing new features of the system, or to replace some (abstract) variables by new (concrete) variables (\emph{data refinement}).  More information about \EventB can be found in~\cite{hoang13:_introd_event_b_model_method}.  \EventB is supported by \Rodin~\cite{abrial10:_rodin}, an extensible toolkit which includes facilities for modelling, verifying the consistency of models using theorem proving and model checking techniques, and validating models with simulation-based approaches.

In \EventB the run to completion pseudocode of Listing~\ref{lst:scxml-r2c} could be represented (somewhat abstractly) as shown in Listing~\ref{lst:eventb-r2c}.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Run to completion pseudocode in \EventB},label={lst:eventb-r2c}, language=Event-B, escapechar=|, frame=single]
 FireUntriggered // Fire  enabled un-triggered transitions
when
    UC = FALSE // Has not yet completed firing un-triggered transitions
    untriggered() /= {}
then
    execute(untriggered()) // Execute enabled un-triggered transitions
end

UntriggeredCompleted // Un-triggered transitions are completed
when
    UC = FALSE // Has not yet completed firing un-triggered transitions
    untriggered() = {} // No more enabled un-triggered transitions
then
    UC = TRUE // Complete firing un-triggered transitions
end

FireInternallyTriggered // Fire an internal trigger
when
    UC = TRUE // Complete firing un-triggered transitions
    IQ /= {} // The internal triggers queue is non-empty
then
    execute(IQ.dequeue) // Execute and dequeue from the internal triggers queue
    UC := FALSE // Re-enable firing of un-triggered transitions
end

FireExternallyTriggered // Fire an external trigger
when
    UC = TRUE // Complete firing un-triggered transitions
    IQ = {} // The internal trigger queue is empty
    EQ /= {} // The external trigger queue is non-empty
then
    execute(EQ.dequeue)  // Execute and dequeue from the external triggers queue
    UC := FALSE // Re-enable firing of un-triggered transitions
end
\end{lstlisting}	
Here, |IQ| and |EQ| are queues of internally and externally, raised triggers, |untriggered| selects a set of currently enabled un-triggered transitions, |dequeue| retrieves the next trigger from the given queue and selects the set of transitions that become enabled by it and |execute| fires the given set of transitions. 
Note that this is an abstract representation where each event (|FireUntriggered|, |FireInternallyTriggered|, and |FireExternallyTriggered|) would be specialised to select a particular set of transitions that can be fired in parallel and |execute()| would be replaced by actions that encode the state changes made by those transitions.
Representing the condition \textbf{untriggered\_enabled} (Line 3 in Listing~\ref{lst:scxml-r2c}) is cumbersome since we would need to write a conjunction of all the possible un-triggered guards. Instead we introduce a dummy un-triggered event that is only fired when no other selection of un-triggered transitions are available and sets a boolean flag, |UC|, to indicate that none of the real un-triggered events was fired and a trigger needs to be consumed.
 
Note that causing all of the
transitions to simultaneously and atomically fire for each event is a
further semantic choice.  Transitions associated with |FireUntriggered|,
|FireInternallyTriggered|, and |FireExternallyTriggered| might
just as well fire separately in a non-deterministic order, or by use
of a per-transition priority, fire in a predetermined order.  Each
choice has realistic exemplars in the physical world, and to some
degree, the choice is arbitrary.  The argument in favour of the
parallel atomic transitions chosen here is pragmatic: the resulting
representation in \EventB is more terse.
