\subsection{iUML-B State-machines}
\label{sec:iumlb}

\iUMLB provides a diagrammatic modelling notation for \EventB in the form of state-machines and class diagrams. 
The diagrammatic models are contained within an \EventB machine and generate or contribute to parts of it. 
For example a state-machine will automatically generate the \EventB data elements (sets, constants, axioms, variables, and invariants) to implement the states while \EventB events are expected to already exist to represent the transitions. 
Transitions contribute further guards and actions representing their state change, to the events that they elaborate.  
State-machines are typically refined by adding nested state-machines to states.
Figure~\ref{fig:iumlb-sm} shows an example of a simple state-machine with two states.

Each state is encoded as a boolean variable and the current state is indicated by one of the boolean variables being set to |TRUE|. 
An invariant ensures that only one state is set to |TRUE| at a time.
%The state-machine, is initialised by setting one state variable to |TRUE| and all others to |FALSE|.
Events change the values of state variables to move the |TRUE| value according to the transitions in the state-machine.
