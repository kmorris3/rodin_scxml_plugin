	abstract="UML-B is a `UML like' notation based on the Event-B formalism which allows models to be progressively detailed through refinements that are proven to be consistent and to satisfy safety invariants using the Rodin platform and its automatic proof tools. UML, on the other hand, encourages large models to be expressed in a single, detailed level and relies on simulation and model testing techniques for verification. The advantage of proof over model-testing is that the proof is valid for all instantiations of the model whereas a simulation must choose a typical instantiation. In the INESS project we take an extant UML model of a railway interlocking system and explore methodical ways to translate it into UML-B in such a way as to facilitate proof that the model satisfies certain safety properties which are expressed as invariants. We describe the translation attempted so far and insights that we have gained from attempting to prove a safety property. We propose some possible improvements to the translation which we believe will make the proof easier.",

abstract="We present a framework for formal veri.cation of a realtime extension of UML statecharts. For clarity, we restrict ourselves to a reasonable subset of the rich UML statechart model and extend this with real-time constructs (clocks, timed guards, and invariants). We equip the obtained formalism, called hierarchical timed automata (HTA), with an operational semantics. We outline a translation of one HTA to a network of flat timed automata, that can serve as input to the real-time model checking tool Uppaal. This translation can be used to faithfully verify deadlock-freedom, safety, and unbounded response properties of the HTA model. We report on an XML-based implementation of this translation, use the well-known pacemaker example to illustrate our technique, and report run-time data for the formal verification part.",
