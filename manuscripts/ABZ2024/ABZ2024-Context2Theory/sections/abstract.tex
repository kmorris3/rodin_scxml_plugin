  The Event-B modelling language has been used to formalise the semantics of other modelling languages such as Time Mobility (TiMo) or State Chart XML (SCXML). Typically, the syntactical elements of the languages are captured as Event-B contexts while the semantical elements are formalised in Event-B machines. An alternative for capturing a modelling language's semantics is to use the Theory plug-in to build datatypes capturing the syntactical elements of the language and operators to represent the various semantical aspects of the language. This paper draws on our experience to compare the two approaches in both modelling and reasoning features.
